#Find My Movies

is a React-Native app that uses the movie database (free to use) to query all types of movies by keyword. It displayes "potential" movies in an infinity scroll list of movies. The list displays the movie title, the poster (if available) a brief descreption and the date of the movie.

##This is the version 1.0 of the app, I'm working on improving this and so can you!
